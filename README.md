# TheHealthWhiz
A website that tabulates and makes COVID data constantly available from the CDC website.

The start of this project began with an idea me and five others during a short hackathon developed. It was developed under 17 hours of constant coding into a finished product. It was able to win second place in the first hackathon of our university.

From here, we hope to continue its development, and when we feel that the product is foolproof, we hope to make this website live as well as create respective Android and iOS apps to let everyone view COVID data in a cohesive manner.
